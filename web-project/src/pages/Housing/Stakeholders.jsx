          <h1>Stakeholders and Involvement</h1>
            <p>When it comes to global stakeholders regarding the issue of affordable housing, there are a number of different government, public, and private sectors that are involved in the planning and development of projects and policies. Primarily, government agencies play a large role globally. The United Nations (UN) is the most recognized organization that focuses on solving affordable housing and other systemic problems on a global scale, with their sub-organization “UN Habitat” specifically focusing on ensuring access to a “safe, secure, habitable, and affordable home” which is deemed a fundamental human right on their website (unhabitat.org, n.d.). Other notable global stakeholders include, but are not limited to, non-government organizations, private developers, community development organizations, civil society and advocacy groups, and those seeking affordable housing themselves. Some specific stakeholders within the three selected countries are given below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>USA</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The United States does not have one primary stakeholder involved in affordable housing efforts but instead a number of different parties engaged in involvement. Larger stakeholders include the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and other federal agencies, state and local government agencies such as State Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) and Local Housing Finance Agencies (LHAs), and non-governmental organizations including Habitat for Humanity. Other stakeholders within the country include politicians, financial institutions, and social and community enterprises (Malik, 2020). Stakeholders whose efforts are more specific to the individual state and community level include homelessness and affordable housing advocates, builder and real estate associations, and low-income advocates (Bonlender, 2017).</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Finland</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stakeholders for affordable housing within the country of Finland are mainly municipality-owned companies along with a small number of nationwide non-profit organizations. Commercial banks and financial institutions such as MuniFin are integral stakeholders in support of sustained affordable housing production, and provide interest subsidized loans that are guaranteed through the state by the Finance and the Development Centre of Finland (ARA) and administered by the Ministry of the Environment. (munifin.fi, 2022). Other stakeholders include nationwide non-profit organizations and investestors in municipality-owned companies (munifin.fi, 2022).</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>India</b></li>

        <h1>Who Does & Doesn&#39;t Have Access To Affordable Housing?</h1>
            <p>Global stakeholders in all three countries who have access to more resources and finances have greater access to affordable housing. Stakeholders in a global context who are of lower income levels or are a part of marginalized populations have limited access to affordable housing, including those who are impacted by a lack of access to affordable housing themselves. Some of the largest stakeholders among all three countries include financial institutions, government organizations, and large corporations. The average salary for a central government employee in Finland in 2022 was $4,545 a month in U.S. dollars, which equates to $54,540 annually (statistica.com, 2024). When looking at an average Indian government employee&#39;s salary in U.S. dollars, $86,335 was the current year average (salary.com, 2024). In the United States, the average federal government employee&#39;s annual current year salary was $106,462 (ziprecruitor.com, 2024). Although an individual&#39;s income is not the sole determinant of securing and accessing affordable housing, Habitat for Humanity deems that the “maximum a family should pay for housing is 30% of their income” (habitat.org, 2024). There is a distinct correlation between a livable income level and access to affordable housing in a global realm as highlighted by the Migration Policy Institute&#39;s website that states: “The housing crisis is complex, characterized by a lack of units especially for low- and middle-income people, and it impacts the native born and immigrants alike” (Solf et al., 2024). In summary, stakeholders who are employees of large corporations, financial institutions, and as outlined above, government organizations, tend to have greater access to affordable housing because they have higher incomes and ultimately more housing opportunities. In comparison, stakeholders suffering from lack of affordable housing themselves– including lower income and marginalized populations such as migrants– have equal investment in yet lower access to affordable housing solutions.</p>
        <h1>Impact of Power Dynamics For Stakeholders</h1>
            <p>Marginalized populations impacted by lack of affordable housing often have less power and input when compared with stakeholders of greater financial stature, such as large corporations and government institutions. Within the United States, those a part of marginalized populations including persons of low-socioeconomic stature and racial minorities have a greater likelihood of low accessibility to affordable housing and experiencing homelessness. (endhomelessness.org, 2023). Multi-level global stakeholder initiatives seeking advancements in affordable housing often include government sectors, large corporations, and financial institutions who have greater power and resources than those in marginalized communities. An article notes, “While local communities are not always included in multi-stakeholder initiatives, their inclusion can increase the legitimacy of decision-making processes and enhance the long-term viability and benefits of initiatives&#34; (Lu et al., 2018). Further, they explain that “Research has shown that large business interests are regularly over-represented and that local communities remain marginalized in the process” (Eikelenboom, b. Long, 2022). This emphasizes the importance of including those experiencing a lack of affordable housing themselves, specifically those in marginalized communities, within global affordable housing efforts to provide sustained and tailored outcomes.</p>
        <h1>Viewpoints of Stakeholders</h1>
            <p>Finland&#39;s multi-level stakeholder platform collectively views affordable housing as a fundamental right for its citizens. MuniFin, a key financial stakeholder in funding affordable housing within the country, states that “the right to housing is enshrined in the Finnish constitution” (munifin.fi, 2022). The other primary stakeholders including ARA and the Ministry of the Environment are united by this viewpoint and collaboratively work to increase the number of affordable homes within the country. India&#39;s key stakeholders do not have a collective approach or viewpoint when it comes to affordable housing. Government organizations such as the Ministry of Rural Development and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation and NGOs such as Platform UnATHI view affordable housing as a necessity for citizens in their efforts. Platform UnATHI&#39;s website notes in their mission they want to build “an ecosystem that enables low-income communities in India to access affordable and sustainable housing stock” and pursue “opportunities to build collaborations among varied stakeholders” (Indian Housing Federation, n.d.). In comparison, other key stakeholders such as housing developers, financial institutions, and construction companies collaborating with the government platforms and NGOs may view the issue as a growth opportunity with financial incentive. Similar to India, the United States does not have a cohesive viewpoint of affordable housing among stakeholders. Viewpoints on the issue differ at federal and local levels. The National Low Income Housing Coalition recognizes “adequate housing as a component of the human right to an adequate standard of living” (Tars, n.d.). Similarly to India, other stakeholders such as housing developers and financial institutions may view affordable housing efforts as a financial incentive. An article discussing U.S. affordable housing stakeholder involvement notes “Certain financial institutions, often the big banks, are highly motivated to serve as both the construction lender and tax credit investor” (Bolour, 2018).</p>
        <h1>Stakeholders&#39; Agreeance of Solutions</h1>
            <p>In a global context, all three countries have similar agreement between their government&#39;s approach and involvement in efforts to increase accessibility to affordable housing. Government stakeholders in Finland and the United States have a designated housing program(s) and are in agreement of the right to housing for its citizens, as enshrined in legal government documents. India&#39;s government differs as “housing is considered an investment asset for individuals rather than a social asset for society as a whole” (Gupta, 2022). Despite this, considering India&#39;s high level of unhoused citizens, a former chief town planner notes the “housing sector is being given priority and ranks high on the agenda of state and central Governments” (Gupta, 2022). Ultimately, other non-governmental stakeholders&#39; opinions on how to handle the issue differs between the three countries. Finland&#39;s stakeholders collaboratively view affordable housing as a societal issue versus an individual one with their approach agreed upon by all key stakeholders, as evidenced through their multi-level platform system who work in alignment. In India and the United States, other key stakeholders share opposing and similar opinions on who should be responsible for solving the issue of affordable housing and what should be done to create better systemic solutions as evidenced by lack of a collaborative stakeholder platform targeting the issue.</p>
        <h1>Ethical Considerations For Stakeholders</h1>
            <p>There are numerous ethical considerations that stakeholders in all three countries must consider when driving affordable housing initiatives and solutions. Primarily, the United Nations states that “the right to adequate housing is a human right recognized in international human rights law as part of the right to an adequate standard of living” which must be considered in the context of global citizens (ohchr.org). Stakeholders must understand that access to affordable housing should not be viewed as a commodity, but rather a basic human right. Other ethical considerations that stakeholders should explore on the global level include environmental impact of housing development, transparent housing policies, access to safe drinking water, long term impact of developing, consideration of gentrification and redlining effects, prioritizing community engagement and voices during initiatives, and lastly, including marginalized communities within the planning of and implementation of systemic change initiatives.</p>
            <p>The considerations discussed above apply to a global context that stakeholders of affordable housing in not only the three countries explored in the paper, but every country, should take into consideration. Ethical considerations were based on the international right to adequate housing.</p>
